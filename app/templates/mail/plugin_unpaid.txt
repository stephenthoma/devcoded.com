We haven't received any payment for your requested
plugin!

{{ user.username }}, your plugin, {{
plugin.name }} must be paid for before development can begin.

In order for development on {{ plugin.name }}
to begin we need to know that our developer will be paid! Don't
worry though, your money is held by us until you've received your
plugin. And, if you're unhappy with the quality of the plugin,
we're happy to work with you to meet your expectations, or if
necessary issue a full refund.

You can pay for your plugin from your user
